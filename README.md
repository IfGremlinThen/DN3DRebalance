# DN3DRebalance
Rebalanced .CON files for Duke Nukem 3D.

## Background
I found Duke Nukem 3D to be a very frustrating game due in large part to hitscan weapons and the need to exhaustively explore levels, sometimes at the cost of finite resources like Scuba Tanks and Nightvision Goggles.  I also wished certain weapons were more powerful (or plentiful) and others were less of a crutch.  Ultimately I ended up editing my own .CON files in an effort to get closer to the experience I wanted.

GAME.CON in particular has been reformatted with comments for significantly improved readability.

Overall, I believe this rebalance makes the game marginally easier, but it is not without significant changes.
